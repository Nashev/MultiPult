(* Title: DUnit Test Project
    This project is a collection of test code, called Test Cases, which are
    intended to ensure code security through revisions and refactorings.
    Currently the only focus of the tests are to compare WAVs before and after
    transcoding with lossless formats. The sources are of various sample rates
    and bit depths. The project should be expanded to include tests for all of
    the various aspects of each component.

    For more information on DUnit, check out http://dunit.sourceforge.net.

    Before running the tests, you will need to download dunit_support.ar from
    http://groups.google.com/group/newac-users/files. This file may have been
    expanded to dunit_support.part01.rar, dunit_support.part02.rar, etc.

    After grabbing that file, extract it to your main NewAC directory, it will
    create files under the bin\ directory. After extracting it, run the included
    executable, "bin\generate_sources.exe" to generate reference files for all
    of the various formats. Note this executable is just a DUnit test with the
    compiler define of GenerateSources as defined in dunit_options.inc.
